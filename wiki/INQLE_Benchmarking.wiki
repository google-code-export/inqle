#summary Describes results of testing against standard data sets

=Benchmarking Tests=
Many of these tests were derived from the [http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html Machine Learning Repository], at the UC Irvine [http://cml.ics.uci.edu/ Center for Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems].  This is a commonly used source of benchmarking data.

The below INQLE tests were run on a 1.6 GHz laptop computer running Windows XP.

|| 11 Feb 2009: INQLE v 0.2.8, using the [SiSSS_Sampler SiSSS Sampling Algorithm] || [http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic) Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set] || "best predictive accuracy obtained using one separating plane in the 3-D space of *Worst Area, Worst Smoothness and Mean Texture*.  Estimated accuracy *97.5%* using repeated 10-fold crossvalidations.  Classifier has correctly diagnosed 176 consecutive new patients as of November 1995." || INQLE v0.2.8 had *96.1%* accuracy, between the diagnosis (of cancer vs. benign), using these attributes: *Worst Radius, Worst Texture, and Mean Concave Points* || <ul><li>Setup & import of data: 10 minutes</li><li>Configure custom sampler to predict breast tumor diagnosis, randomly selecting from 1 to 3 other attributes to build correlative model: 5 minutes</li><li>Random experimentation: Completed 5754 random experiments in 6 hours. (3.7 seconds per experiment)</li></ul> || This _classification_ experiment tests INQLE's performance in selecting among 30 _numeric attributes_, which are highly correlated with the label (the attribute being predicted). ||
