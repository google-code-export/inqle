#summary Describes results of testing against standard data sets

=Benchmarking Tests=
Many of these tests were derived from the [http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html Machine Learning Repository], at the UC Irvine [http://cml.ics.uci.edu/ Center for Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems].  This is a commonly used source of benchmarking data.

The below INQLE tests were run on a 1.6 GHz laptop computer running Windows XP.

|| Date || *Test* || *Benchmark Results* || *INQLE Results* || *INQLE Details* ||
|| 7 Feb 2009: INQLE v 0.2.6 || [http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic) Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set] || "best predictive accuracy obtained using one separating plane in the 3-D space of *Worst Area, Worst Smoothness and Mean Texture*.  Estimated *accuracy 97.5%* using repeated 10-fold crossvalidations.  Classifier has correctly diagnosed 176 consecutive new patients as of November 1995." || INQLE v0.2.6 found *91.8% correlation*, between the diagnosis (of cancer vs. benign), using these attributes: *Worst Concavity, Mean Area, and Mean Smoothness* || Setup & import of data: 10 minutes<br>Configure custom sampler to predict breast tumor diagnosis, randomly selecting from 1 to 3 other attributes to build correlative model: 5 minutes<br>Random experimentation: Completed 4654 experiments in 7 hours.
