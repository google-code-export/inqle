#summary How to load data into INQLE

== Introduction ==

INQLE works with semantic, [http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-rdf-syntax/ RDF data].  This permits INQLE to recognize the relationships of the data, and to select a random sampling of learnable data.  So INQLE requires data to be imported as RDF.

INQLE can import data from a number of sources.

== Import from Comma-Separated (CSV) or other Delimited Text File ==
Most data seems to be stored in spreadsheets.  Spreadsheets are great for collecting and working with a set of data, but within a spreadsheet, there is little semantic info such as the identities of the things represented or the relationships between them.

To facilitate importing data into INQLE, we provide a File Data Importer Wizard.  This wizard walks you through the steps of capturing data that is explicitly stored in a spreadsheet, as well as implicit data, about the spreadsheet, that does not appear in the spreadsheet.  

Before using the wizard, you should get your data into a spreadsheet program, and select File -> Save as -> 
and select to save your spreadsheet as Comma-Seperated Values (CSV) or delimited text file.

Next start the wizard, right click a dataset in your INQLE Administrator, and select Load data from a file".

Next, click *Browse* and find your CSV file, and click *Open*.  Click *Upload*.

Click *Next*.  You should see the first few rows of your CSV data.

Here you can specify date information about your data.  If your CSV all pertains to a single date or time, then you can select that all data being imported has the same date and time, and enter this date (and optionally time).
Alternatively, if each row of data pertains to a different date, then specify below which column contains this date information.

Click *Next*.  The remaining steps of the wizard will specify the type and identity of the _subjects_ of your data, plus the _attributes_ of those subjects.  For each subject we fist specify if the table represents a single individual or if instead each row of data pertains to a different individual.

First, we must determine if you will identify a single individual subject, or if instead each r
