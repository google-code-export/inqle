#summary How to load data into INQLE

== Introduction ==

INQLE works with semantic, [http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-rdf-syntax/ RDF data].  This permits INQLE to recognize the relationships of the data, and to select a random sampling of learnable data.  So INQLE requires data to be imported as RDF.

INQLE can import data from a number of sources.

== Import from Comma-Separated (CSV) or other Delimited Text File ==
Most data seems to be stored in spreadsheets.  Spreadsheets are great for collecting and working with a set of data, but within a spreadsheet, there is little semantic info such as the identities of the things represented or the relationships between them.

To facilitate importing data into INQLE, we provide a File Data Importer Wizard.  This wizard walks you through the steps of capturing data that is explicitly stored in a spreadsheet, as well as implicit data, about the spreadsheet, that does not appear in the spreadsheet.  

Before using the wizard, you should get your data into a spreadsheet program, and select File -> Save as -> 
and select to save your spreadsheet as Comma-Seperated Values (CSV) or delimited text file.

To start the wizard, right click a dataset in your INQLE Administrator, and select "Load data from a file...".

You will now see the file data importer wizard.  Click *Browse* and find your CSV file, and click *Open*.  Click *Upload*.

Click *Next*.  You should see the first few rows of your CSV data.

Here you can specify date information about your data.  If your CSV all pertains to a single date or time, then you can select that all data being imported has the same date and time, and enter this date (and optionally time).
Alternatively, if each row of data pertains to a different date, then specify below which column contains this date information.  If your data does not pertain to any dates, you can leave the form as it is.

Click *Next*.  The remaining steps of the wizard will specify the things that your data is about, plus the _attributes_ of those things.  

For the purposes of this wizard, there are 2 types of things.
  # _Subjects_ are things that describe a single row in the table.  When importing subjects, you must specify what type of thing each subject is a member of.  Example: we are importing a spreadsheet of companies.  The subject type is "company", and each row represents a different instance of that type (i.e., each row is a different company).
  # _Captions_ are things that describe the entire table.  Each row does not represent a new thing of the same type.  Rather, the caption represents a single thing.
  Example: the above table of companies is our company's list of suppliers.  So we might add a caption of the type "company", with an identifier of "Our Company".  Another example: we are importing prices of the S&P 500 Index.  We define a single caption, of type "stock index", specifically "the S&P 500 Index".
