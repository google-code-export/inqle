#summary How to load dat into INQLE

= Introduction =

INQLE works with semantic, [http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-rdf-syntax/ RDF data].  This permits INQLE to recognize the relationships of the data, and to select a random sampling of learnable data.  So INQLE requires data to be imported as RDF.

INQLE can import data from a number of sources.

= 1. Import from Comma-Separated (CSV) or other Delimited Text File =
Most data seems to be stored in spreadsheets.  Spreadsheets are great for collecting and working with a set of data, but within a spreadsheet, there is little semantic info identities of the things represented or the relationships between them.  So to import data from a spreadsheet, you must convert it to RDF.

To facilitate importing data into IQNLE, we provide a File Data Importer Wizard.  This wizard walks you through the steps of capturing data that is explicitly stored in a spreadsheet, as well as implicit data, about the spreadsheet, that does not appear in the spreadsheet.
