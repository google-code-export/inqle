#summary Explains briefly how to browse your data

Data in INQLE is semantic, RDF, in structure.  Thus it is _faceted_, meaning it consists of objects, with many properties that link to other ojects.  

To browse the data that you have loaded into an INQLE database, navigate in the navigation tree (at left) to:
Databases -> user -> [datamodel name]
Select "Browse data".  You will see the classes of objects in your database.  Select a class, and you will see a list of the objects of that class.  You can paginate through this list.  Select an object and you will see all the _facets_ of this object.
