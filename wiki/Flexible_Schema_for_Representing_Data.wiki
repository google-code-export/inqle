#summary INQLE uses a flexible schema for representing any type of data.

This page describes INQLE's generic schema, which can be used to represent any experimental data or other data with a time component.

INQLE stores and works with semantic, RDF data.  It seeks to handle most any structure (schema) of RDF data.  When INQLE creates semantic data (by importing from a non-semantic spreadsheet, by survey data it collects, or by other means), INQLE uses a flexible schema for representing any type of data.  This schema enables INQLE to ensure that the data it creates is identified by existing semantic classes, while containing maximal information about each datum.  This schema could be used to represent any data semantically, whether for use in data mining or any other purpose.

Here are the particulars of this schema.

(1) Each datum has a single *subject*.  

(2) Each data subject is identified by a URI.  Where possible, URIs of known entities are used. 

(3) Each data subject is an instance of a particular semantic class (RDFS or OWL).  Where possible, an existing semantic class is used.

(4) Each data subject has _identifying_ attributes.  Such attributes are those that generally do NOT change.   Most notably, it has a URI, which identifies it globally.  _Identifying_ attributes are represented by already-existing semantic properties of the subject's semantic class, when available.  If the subject's semantic class lacks the needed property, then a new _identifying_ attribute can be declared to be a property of the subject's semantic class.  In either case, the _identifying_ attribute values are properties of the data subject.

(5) Each data subject has _measurement_ attributes.  Such attributes are values which DO change.  These are the types of attributes which contain minable information.  _Measurement_ attributes are NOT properties of the subject itself.  Rather, they are properties of a new semantic class, called:
http://ns.inqle.org/Data
which is abbreviated to
inqle:Data

(6) The property inqle:Data can contain any type of property suited to the subject it is about.  If a particular inqle:Data instance is about a person, the that inqle:data instance might have attributes
hasHeight
hasAge
isInPhaseOfSleep

(7) Some properties are common among most instances of inqle:Data.  These properties include
inqle:hasSubject - identifies the data subject.
inqle:date - identifies the date and time of the measurement

date




If that subject represents a group of multiple individuals (like a married couple), then the subject is the group itself (like the URI of the couple object, which in turn has
