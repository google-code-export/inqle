#summary INQLE uses a flexible schema for representing any type of data.

This page describes INQLE's generic schema, which can be used to represent any experimental data or other data with a time component.

INQLE stores and works with semantic, RDF data.  It seeks to handle most any structure (schema) of RDF data.  When INQLE creates semantic data (by importing from a non-semantic spreadsheet, by survey data it collects, or by other means), INQLE uses a flexible schema for representing any type of data.  This schema enables INQLE to ensure that the data it creates is identified by existing semantic classes, while containing maximal information about each datum.  This schema could be used to represent any data semantically, whether for use in data mining or any other purpose.

Here are the particulars of this schema.

(1) All data has a single subject.  

(2) Each data subject is identified by a semantic class (RDFS or OWL).  Where possible, an existing semantic class is used.

(3) Each subject might have a number of _identifying_ attributes.  Such attributes are those that generally do not change.  They generally 

If that subject represents a group of multiple individuals (like a married couple), then the subject is the group itself (like the URI of the couple object, which in turn has
