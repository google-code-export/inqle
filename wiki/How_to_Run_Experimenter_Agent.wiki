#summary How to run INQLE's Experimenter Agent.

INQLE's Experimenter Agent repeatedly runs experiments.  Specifically, it repeatedly runs a sampler, then applies the sample of data against an appropriate !RapidMiner learning algorithm.  It stores the results of its experiment as RDF.

You may create a customized experimenter agent.  For now, we will simply run the base (uncustomized) experimenter agent.  This will randomly select from among all available samplers to gather a chunk of learnable data, and then will select reandomly from among !RapidMiner experiments that can process that chunk.  When completed, it will randomly select another sampler and run it.  And so on.

You can create customizations of existing samplers by running a wizard, [How_to_Create_Custom_Sampler as described here].  Alternatively, you can create new sampling algorithms by creating a new sampler plugin.  

To start the Experimenter Agent, first find and right click on the *Experimenter Agent*.
