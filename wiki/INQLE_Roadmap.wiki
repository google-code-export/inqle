Below are the milestones, past and future, for project INQLE


= Releases =

==Version 0.1==
(released in June 2008)  

First release, with basic functionality for local data.
  * Eclipse RAP-based user interface, in Equinox OSGi container
  * Management of Jena-based RDF databases
  * Single sampling algorithm: !SimpleSparqlSampler, which extracts example set, in which each row has common set of predicates
  * !RapidMiner-based experiments
  * Jenabean-based Object-RDF persistence
  * Full support for running the learning cycle
  * Extensible, runnable agent plugin type, including agent for running 
  * support for customization of LearningCycle and/or its components
  * viewing history of experiment results
  * embedded H2 database, for simplified installation

==Version 0.1.5==
(expected early October, 2008)

Improved usability, without need to enter URIs.
  * New data importer, which captures both explicit and implicit data from spreadsheets, and enables the user to search existing stores of subjects and properties.
  * The Central INQLE Server provides a registry for sharing the subjects and properties that other inqle servers have used, permitting standardization and cross-linking of data.
  * User name + password required to access the server

==Version 0.2==
(expected end of 2008)

Enhanced connectivity to data.
  * Sampling algorithm which caters to data imported via the File Data Importer.
  * Support for multiple user accounts
  * Use of SPARQL endpoints as INQLE datasets
  * INQLE servers are SPARQL endpoints
  * Usability fixes

==Version 0.3==
(expected end of March, 2009)

Expanded Reach
  * Sampling algorithms which combine local with remote data
  * Survey module: user creates/reuses survey questions, adds participant emails, specifies parameters such as frequency and duration of mailings, and starts the survey.
