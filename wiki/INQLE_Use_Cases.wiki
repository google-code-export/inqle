#summary Describes examples of functions INQLE can be used for

|| *Minimum INQLE Version* || *You want to...* || *Description* ||
|| 0.2.7 || Convert regular data to semantic data (RDF) || You want to convert your soon-to-be-famous spreadsheet of Dishwasher Observations (DO), to semantic data.  To do this, you use INQLE's File Data Importer Wizard, which walks you through the process of naming and structuring the new RDF.  You are finished in minutes.  ||
|| 0.2.9 || Publish your RDF to the world. || You want your RDF database to be downloadable and used by the great unwashed.  Having loaded your data (above), your data is already published to the web, for all to see.  For models with over 40,000 statements, INQLE does not publish these as they are rather large.  ||
|| 0.2.7 || Data mine local data set, with no understanding of data mining. || You seek to find what is causing your frequent hives.   You keep a personal diary of activities you do every day, including foods you eat.  You record such data in a spreadsheet.  You import it into INQLE and run INQLE's Learning Agent for a few hours.   You return to INQLE and find that hives episodes tend to correlate with mornings in which you floss your teeth.  You try getting a new brand of tooth floss, and you live happily ever after, in a blissful hives-free state.  It's just that easy, folks. ||
