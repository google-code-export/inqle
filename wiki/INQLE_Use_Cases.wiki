#summary Describes examples of functions INQLE can be used for

|| *Minimum INQLE Version* || *Use Case* || *Description* ||
|| 0.2.7 || Converting regular data to semantic data (RDF) || You want to load your soon-to-be-famous spreadsheet of Dishwasher Observations (DO).  To do this, you use INQLE's File Data Importer Wizard, which walks you through the process of naming and structuring the new RDF. ||
|| 0.2.9 || Publish your RDF to the world. || You want your RDF database to be downloaded and used by the great unwashed.  Having loaded your data previously, your data is published to the web, for all to see, except for large models with over 40,000 statements ||
|| 0.2.7 || Data mining of local data set, with no understanding of data mining || You seek to find what is causing your frequent hives.   You keep a personal diary of activities you do every day, including foods you eat.  You record such data in a spreadsheet, and save the file.  You import it into INQLE and run INQLE's Learning Agent for a few hours.   You return to INQLE and find that hives episodes tend to correlate with mornings in which you floss your teeth.  You try getting a new brand of tooth floss, and you live happily ever after, in a blissful hives-free state.  It's just that easy, folks. ||
