#summary Describes what types of plugins are available for INQLE.

INQLE runs within an Eclipse OSGi container.  This means it was developed to have maximal firendlienss for plugins.  Where possible, INQLE's functionality has been abstracted into plugin types.  Thus, most of the functions that INQLE performs can be expanded in new directions.

INQLE provides the following plugin types

|| *Plugin* || *Identifier* || *Description* ||
|| Samplers || [Building_Sampler_Plugins org.inqle.data.sampling.rap.ISamplerFactory] || Data sampling is the core task that INQLE performs, in the course of learning about data.  Sophisticated samplers can perform advanced activities, like combining local data with remote data or learning from past experiments.  To make your own sampler, you write Java code that implements interface ISamplerFactory or extends class ASamplerFactory.  Sampler Factories, in turn, can provide the sampler, which will do the work, and optionally a SamplerWizard, which permits users to customize your sampler in the user interface. ||

|| Agents || [Building_Agent_Plugins org.inqle.agent.rap.IAgentFactory] || Agents perform automated tasks.  Most notably, the Experimenter Agent performs releated Learning Cycles.  Other agents could do activities like polling local databases for irregularities, or crawling external RDF databases, looking for data of interest.  To make your own agent, you write Java code that implements interface IAgentFactory or extends class AAgentFactory.  Agent factories, in turn, provide agents that do the work of the automated agent, and optionally an Agent Wizard, which allows the user to customize of the agent in the user interface. ||
