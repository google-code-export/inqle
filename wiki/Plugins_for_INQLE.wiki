#summary Describes what types of plugins are available for INQLE.

INQLE runs within an Eclipse OSGi container.  This means it was developed to have maximal friendliness for plug-ins.  Where possible, INQLE's functionality has been abstracted into extension types.  Thus, most of the functions that INQLE performs can be expanded in new directions.

INQLE provides the following extension types

|| *Extension type* || *Identifier* || *Description* ||
|| Samplers || [Sampler_Extensions org.inqle.data.sampling.rap.ISamplerFactory] || Data sampling is the core task that INQLE performs, in the course of learning about data.  Sophisticated samplers can perform advanced activities, like combining local data with remote data or learning from past experiments.  To make your own sampler, you write Java code that implements interface ISamplerFactory or extends class ASamplerFactory.  Sampler Factories, in turn, can provide the sampler, which will do the work, and optionally a !SamplerWizard, which permits users to customize your sampler in the user interface. ||
|| !RapidMiner Experiments || [RapidMiner_Experiment Extensions org.inqle.experiment.rapidminer.IRapidMinerExperiment] || !RapidMiner experiments are XML files, authored using the !RapidMiner data mining application.  A !RapidMiner experiment specifies the method by which a sample of data will be processed, in search of correlations.   Contributing plugins of this type involves no Java programming. ||
|| Agents || [Agent_Extensions org.inqle.agent.rap.IAgentFactory] || Agents perform automated tasks.  Most notably, the Experimenter Agent performs releated Learning Cycles.  Other agents could do activities like polling local databases for irregularities, or crawling external RDF databases, looking for data of interest.  To make your own agent, you write Java code that implements interface IAgentFactory or extends class AAgentFactory.  Agent factories, in turn, provide agents that do the work of the automated agent, and optionally an Agent Wizard, which allows the user to customize of the agent in the user interface. ||
|| 
||Part Types || [Part_Type_Extensions org.inqle.ui.rap.IPartType] || Part Types are types of things which can appear in the application's left navigation window.  Your part type will appear listed and navigable, just as Samplers, Learnng Cycles, and Agents. ||
|| Internal Datasets || [Internal_Dataset_Extensions org.inqle.data.datasets] || When you create an extension of this type, you are defining an internal dataset that you would like to use within INQLE.  INQLE will ensure this dataset is created upon startup.  Your plugin code can then store objects/data in this dataset, query it, etc.  Users cannot directly work with such datasets.  ||
|| Dataset Functions (or Purposes) || [Dataset_Function_Extensions org.inqle.data.datasetFunctions] || When you create an extension of this type, you are defining a dataset function that you would like to use within INQLE.  INQLE will permit users to designate datasets as fulfilling this function.  Your plugin code can then query or work with such datasets.  INQLE uses an extension of this type to allow users to load data for lookup of subjects and predicated upon import. ||
|| JUnit Tests || [JUnit_Test_Extensions org.inqle.testing.IJUnitTests] || If you have JUnit test code which you would like to run within your running INQLE server, you can declare them using this extension type.  This is a convenient way to test how your plugin will interact with other running parts of INQLE.  ||
|| Views || [Eclipse_View_Extensions org.eclipse.ui.views] || Views are an Eclipse concept.  They are a way to provide a page or form or report, which can be rendered in INQLE's user interface.  A View that you provide in this way will show up in the main menu, under the "Window" menu option. ||
|| Servlets || [Eclipse_Servlet_Extensions org.eclipse.equinox.http.registry.servlets] || Servlets are an Equinox extension type.  You can create an extension of this type if you need to add a servlet to your inqle server, listening and responding to requests for whatever reason. ||
