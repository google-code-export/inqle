=INQLE Architecture=

INQLE is a standalone, server-based Java application.  It should run on most operating systems.  It has been tested on Windows XP, Linux, and Mac OSX.

INQLE embeds the following open source products.
|| [http://jena.sourceforge.net/images/jena-logo-small.png] || [http://jena.sourceforge.net/ Jena Semantic Web Framework] || *Jena* is a mature, active toolkit for performing a host of advanced functions with semantic (RDF) data.  Supported by HP Labs, it has a vibrant community, and it undergoes continuous development. ||
|| [http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3538/3357219707_716e58b5a7_o.png] || [http://code.google.com/p/jenabean/ Jenabean persistence toolkit] || *Jenabean* is an object-to-RDF persistence framework, which gives INQLE the powerful capability to create and store data objects, and do semantic queries to find and retrieve them.  This permits INQLE contributors to easily create and store data, without needing to alter the back-end data model. ||
|| [http://rapid-i.com/images/stories/rapidi/products/RapidMiner/rapidminer_logo.gif] || [http://rapidminer.com RapidMiner Machine Learning Suite] || *!RapidMiner* is a fully-functional data mining suite.  It permits creation of advanced data mining experiments.  INQLE includes !RapidMiner under the hood, automating selection and execution of the statistical number crunching.  Experiments authored in the !RapidMiner tool can be added to INQLE as plug-ins, to extend INQLE's machine learning capabilities. ||
|| [http://www.eclipse.org/eclipse.org-common/themes/Nova/images/eclipse.png] || [http://www.eclipse.org/rap/ Eclipse Rich AJAX Platform (RAP)] || *RAP* is a framework for creating rich browser-based user interface, that operates like the famous [http://www.eclipse.org/ Eclipse desktop application].  It runs on Equinox OSGi, which is a engine for running applications in a plugin-friendly manner. ||

==Plugin Framework==
INQLE runs in a plug-in framework called [http://www.eclipse.org/equinox/ Equinox OSGi], (from [http://www.eclipse.org/ Eclipse]). As such, the core application consists of a number of component plugins, also known as "bundles", each of which contributes a set of functionality. This infrastructure permits INQLE to be extended, through contribution of new bundles. Below is a synopsis of the bundles that comprise the core INQLE server.

Here is a list of OSGi bundles which we have developed, to facilitate INQLE's functionality.

|| *Bundle* || *Description* ||
|| org.inqle.core || Contains core INQLE constants and utilities. ||
|| org.inqle.core.extensions || Contains utilities for working with Eclipse extensions. ||
|| org.inqle.core.db|| Contains JDBC libraries for connecting to the abobe listed relational databases. ||
|| [Bundle_org_inqle_data_rdf_jenabean org.inqle.data.rdf.jenabean] || Contains Jena toolkit, for working with RDF, Jenabean library for Java-to-RDF persistence, and adaptor code for simplifying both SPARQL queries and persisting INQLE objects in an RDF store. ||
|| [Bundle_org_inqle_ui_rap org.inqle.ui.rap] || Contains code for running the web-based user interface, using Eclipse RAP.  Includes UI code for wizards for making database connections, dataset objects (!RDBModel). ||
|| [Bundle_org_inqle_experiment_rapidminer org.inqle.experiment.rapidminer] || Contains [http://rapid-i.com/content/blogcategory/10/69/ RapidMiner] library, and code for executing the Learning Cycle.  Also includes user interface code for creating custom Learning Cycles. ||
|| [Bundle_org_inqle_agent org.inqle.agent] || Contains code for running automated agents, plus provides a basic implementation for running !JUnit tests from the RAP user interface. ||

==Eclipse RAP User Interface==
[http://www.eclipse.org/rap/ Eclipse RAP] is a web application framework, for generating functional web applications, with similar emphasis on productivity that is the hallmark of  the extremely successful [http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/Rich_Client_Platform Eclipse desktop client].

The INQLE interface thus is a rich, AJAX-based web page.  Coding for Eclipse RAP is 80% identical to coding an application based on Eclipse RCP (Rich Client Platform).  The RAP framework translates the Java code into appropriate mix of front-end HTML and AJAX-powered Javascript, and back-end Java code running on the Server.  The complexity inherent in such server-to-rich client interaction is hidden by the RAP framework.

==!RapidMiner Machine Learning Suite==
INQLE incorporates this best-of-breed machine learning tool, to perform its data mining experiments.  Users can author new machine learning experiments using the fine open source application [http://rapid-i.com/content/blogcategory/10/69/ RapidMiner], and add them to INQLE as plugins.
