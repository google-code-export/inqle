=INQLE Architecture=

INQLE is a standalone, server-based application. It runs on any operating system. As a prerequisite, it requires only Java 1.5 and above, and a Relational database system. [[http://jena.sourceforge.net/SDB/|Supported RDBMS]] include
  * MySQL
  * PostgreSQL
  * MSSQL
  * Oracle
  * IBM DB2
  * HSQLDB
  * Derby

INQLE runs in a plug-in framework called [http://www.eclipse.org/equinox/|Equinox OSGi], (from [http://www.eclipse.org/|Eclipse]). As such, the core application consists of a number of component plugins, also known as "bundles", each of which contributes a set of functionality. This infrastructure permits INQLE to be extended, through contribution of new bundles. Below is a synopsis of the bundles that comprise the core INQLE server.

Here is a list of bundles.
