=INQLE Architecture=

INQLE is a standalone, server-based application. It runs on any operating system. As a prerequisite, it requires only Java 1.5 and above, and a Relational database system. [http://jena.sourceforge.net/SDB/ Supported RDBMS] include
  * MySQL
  * PostgreSQL
  * MSSQL
  * Oracle
  * HSQLDB
  * Derby

INQLE runs in a plug-in framework called [http://www.eclipse.org/equinox/ Equinox OSGi], (from [http://www.eclipse.org/ Eclipse]). As such, the core application consists of a number of component plugins, also known as "bundles", each of which contributes a set of functionality. This infrastructure permits INQLE to be extended, through contribution of new bundles. Below is a synopsis of the bundles that comprise the core INQLE server.

Here is a list of bundles.

|| *Bundle* || *Description* ||
|| [Bundle_org_inqle_core org.inqle.core] || Contains core INQLE constants and utilities. ||
|| org.inqle.core.extensions || Contains utilities for working with Eclipse extensions. ||
|| [Bundle_org_inqle_data_rdf_jenabean org.inqle.data.rdf.jenabean] || Contains Jena toolkit, for working with RDF, Jenabean library for Java-to-RDF persistence, and adaptor code for simplifying both SPARQL queries and persisting INQLE objects in RDF store ||
|| [Bundle_org_inqle_ui_rap org.inqle.ui.rap] || Contains code for running the web-based user interface, using Eclipse RAP.  Includes UI code for wizards for making database connections, dataset objects (RDBModel). ||
|| [Bundle_org_inqle_experiment_rapidminer org.inqle.experiment.rapidminer] || Contains RapidMiner library, and java classes for . ||
